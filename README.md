# Fake Screenshot
> This is a website that can **forge** twitter.com, weibo.com, zhihu.com, douban.com, jianshu.com, and other website's screenshots, but the purpose of this website is to tell (people that do not understand programming) ordinary people: **Do not trust those "screenshots" seen online easily!**

If one day you see such a picture online, what is your first reaction?

“holy shit, so fast?”

“have the time recently, Learn!”

“What's the difference with 2.0?”

"How is the compatibility with TS?"

**In any case, as long as the first reaction is not to doubt it's authenticity, then you are the victim of "fake screenshot"!**



We have all seen various screenshots: including but not limited to `Twitter`, `Facebook`, `Reddit`, `Youtube`, `Tumblr`, `media reports`...

That will be fine if those screenshots only involved jokes or life stuff, but some of them are not. They are often related to something/someone. This (fake screenshot) is very likely to lead people to make a wrong opinion about the thing/ Person (the reason why I say so is I think most fake pictures producers have a bad motivation.)

In addition, **most people will not actively verify the authenticity of the screenshot **(the reason for not doing this is not discussed here), which is one of the important reasons for the proliferation of "fake screenshots".

**So what can I do?**

Three directions: 

1. Prevent the spread of screenshots (**very difficult to achieve**) 
2. Tell people to take the initiative to verify (**hard to achieve**)
3. **At least tell people to keep skeptical (is possible).**

I chose the third direction. I chose to do the opposite, **to write a website that helps people to make fake screenshots** of common websites and software (of course, the content can be customized by the user) easily.

**Tell people (ordinary person who does not understand programming) something like this: "Holy shit, the screenshots of the websites/apps can be faked!**

> How to spread our "falsification" website?

> When people make a fake screenshot, we will add a "very insignificant" watermark pointing to our site.



So you think that when this person sees those screenshots again, will he be suspicious of the content subconsciously?
